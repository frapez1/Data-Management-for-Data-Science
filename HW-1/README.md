## Part 1

### HW Text

Choose an application domain and, using a relational DBMS, build a database. This can be done in two ways:

 * Use an interesting existing dataset, i.e.:
    1. get interesting data from the Web or other sources (e.g., use the Web to look for a whole database, or data that can be easily imported into a relational DBMS) and build a relational database using such data
    2. formulate a set of SQL queries (about 8-10) over the relational schema
    3. execute such queries over the database and analyze the results
    4. NOTICE: all datasets are fine EXCEPT MOVIE DATASETS (too many projects used movie DBs in the previous years)
 * create the schema and the dataset from scratch, i.e.:
    1. define the relational schema (i.e., write SQL statements to create tables defining attributes, domains, and possibly integrity constaints);
    2. insert tuples into tables (through SQL statements)
    3. formulate a set of SQL queries (about 10) over the relational schema
    4. execute such queries over the database and analyze the results
