# HW-2

## Text

Use a NoSQL tool (graph database, column database, key-value database, column-family database) to manage and query a dataset. Ideally, the groups should use the same dataset as the one used in the first (and/or second) homework. Examples of such systems include (but are not limited to) Neo4J, GraphDB, Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra (see the course material on aggregate databases, graph databases and RDF databases for more details).
